# React Template

This is a simple boilerplate for React with React Router.

HTML Body is configured for single page app (no margin and full page width/height). React content will be rendered to a div with id `container`.

Webpack, Babel and ESLint are all pre-configured. This enables starting to use React without having to understand all of them first (it's a good idea to look into them afterwards though).

## How to start ?

In a command line, on the project level, run the following commands to install and watch the JS files 

```{.sh}
#Install NPM Packages
npm install
#Start the JS file bundling and watch for modifications
npm start
```

Then, simply open the index.html file in your browser and you're done.
